  <h2 id='h2' class='c006'>Uncle Wiggily’s Fishing Trip Or The Good Luck He Had With the Clothes Hook</h2>
</div>
<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i004.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you going, boys?” asked Uncle Wiggily Longears, the
bunny rabbit gentleman one day, as he stood in front of his hollow stump
bungalow. Nurse Jane was on the steps, shaking the wrinkles out of the
table cloth. Going past, with poles over their shoulders, was Jackie
Bow Wow, the puppy dog boy, and Charlie Chick, the little rooster chap.
“Where are you going?” Uncle Wiggily asked them. “Fishing,” answered
Jackie. “Don’t you want to come?” crowed Charlie, the rooster. “Yes,
I think I might go, later on, perhaps,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i005.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Nurse Jane, as she looked out the window.
“You’ll let all my nicely washed clothes down in the mud if you
loosen that line! Please stop!” Uncle Wiggily stopped, but he said: “I
want a bit of line to go fishing with, Nurse Jane. You have more than
you need here.” The muskrat lady laughed. “I’ll get you an extra piece
that has no clothes hanging on it,” she said. “But aren’t you afraid the
sharp hook will hurt the fish you catch?” Uncle Wiggily shook his head.
“I’m going to use a smooth hammock hook,” he said.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i006.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“So you are going fishing, are you?” Nurse Jane called after the
bunny rabbit gentleman who hopped down the road. “Yes,” he answered.
“You gave me a bit of clothes line, I’ll use my rheumatism crutch for a
pole, the dull hammock hook will not hurt the fish, and for bait I’ll give
them some of the cherry pie you put up for my lunch.” Nurse Jane
waved her paw, and said she hoped the bunny gentleman would have good
luck and bring home plenty of fish. “Uncle Wiggily thinks he’ll catch
something,” said the Pipsisewah to Skeezicks, “but we’ll catch him!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i007.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Well, now I am all ready to begin fishing,” said Uncle Wiggily to
himself, as he sat down on a green, mossy bank, in a shady nook beside
a little brook. “I’ll bait the dull hammock hook with a nice, sweet, juicy
bit of cherry pie, and then we’ll see what I shall catch.” Hiding behind
the rabbit gentleman, in the bushes, the Skeezicks and Pipsisewah whispered
to one another about catching Uncle Wiggily. “I only hope I don’t
spoil my nice, new hat,” said the Skee. “And I hope nothing happens
to my new cap,” spoke the Pip. Uncle Wiggily knew nothing of this.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i008.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Dear me hum suz dud and some slippery eels!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“What is this I have caught without even wetting my hook in the brook?
I declare! It’s a fine hat! I’ll take it home and Nurse Jane can fix it
up for me! Hats cost money. Now I have a new one for nothing!”
Uncle Wiggily’s hook had snatched the hat off the head of the Skeezicks
hiding in the bushes. And oh, how surprised the Skee was. Likewise
the Pipsisewah. “Come on, let’s grab him quick!” cried the bad chaps.
“He’ll catch us on the hook next!” So they got ready to get the bunny.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i009.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I do declare!” cried Uncle Wiggily, as once more he swung
his hook and line around his head. “I seem to be having the queerest
luck today! First I catch a hat and then I catch a cap. Well, so much
the better for me. They are both quite sporty. Now I will not have to
buy anything to cover my head all winter. But I must try to catch a fish
for Nurse Jane.” The bad Skeezicks and the worse Pipsisewah were dancing
up and down, they were so mad. “It’s all your fault!” howled the Pip
as he saw his fine cap snatched away. “No, it’s yours!” gargled the Skee.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i010.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Now to see what I catch this time!” cried Uncle Wiggily, as once
more, he swung his hook and line around his head. “Come on!” cried
the Pip to the Skee. “Come on! This is no place for us! First thing
we know he’ll catch us on that hook!” The Skee began to run, saying:
“Uncle Wiggily is too good a fisherman for us. We’ll have to try again!”
The bunny gentleman had put the hat and cap down on the grass beside
him. Then he saw Jackie Bow Wow and Charlie Chick coming along.
The puppy dog boy and the rooster chap had caught nothing.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Look!” cried Jackie Bow Wow, as he and the
bunny gentleman and Charlie Chick stopped in front of a drug store on
their way home from the fishing trip. “Look! Special sale of ice cream
cones!” Charlie Chick said: “I wonder how they taste?” Uncle Wiggily,
who had not caught any fish, any more than had the puppy and rooster,
sort of blinked his eyes. “I wonder how much those gold minnows are?”
he said to himself. “I’m going in and ask. I guess I can buy gold fish
with silver money. And we’ll see about some ice cream cones, too!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Uncle Wiggily, did you have good luck?” asked Nurse Jane,
as, standing at the gate of the hollow stump bungalow, she saw Mr. Longears
coming back from his fishing trip. “Good luck? I should say so!
I caught a cap and a hat, and a glass bowl full of fish.” Nurse Jane
laughed. “Did you catch anything, Jackie and Charlie?” she asked. “Ice
cream cones,” answered the puppy dog and rooster chap. “They’re better
than fish!” And back in their dens the Pip and Skee had nothing but
cold potatoes for supper, and they had to wear an old cap and hat.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>And if the wind doesn’t blow the smoke out of the chimney, and tickle the gold fish so it sneezes itself out of the water into the condensed milk, the next pictures and story will tell how</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>The Pipsisewah and the Skeezicks Knew Not What Uncle Wiggily Had in the Bag. But When They Found Out! Oh My! Oh My!</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i014.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the bunny rabbit gentleman, leaned on the
gate in front of his hollow stump bungalow one day. He was all dressed
up to take a walk, but didn’t know where to go. All at once he saw
Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the two squirrel boys. “Where are you
going, Johnnie and Billie?” asked the bunny uncle. “We are going to the
woods for some chestnuts and hickorynuts,” answered Johnnie. “Mother
puts them in our cake.” Uncle Wiggily said that was fine. “I wonder
if Nurse Jane will bake a cake if I get some nuts?” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i015.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Nurse Jane,” asked Uncle Wiggily, as he gave a hop, skip and jump
back into the hollow stump bungalow, after Billie and Johnnie had scampered
on down the woodland path, “Nurse Jane, if I get some hickorynuts,
or chestnuts, will you bake them in a cake for me?” She said she would,
and be very glad to. So Uncle Wiggily found an empty flour bag and,
slinging it over his shoulder, off he started to find some nuts in the
woods. “And please be careful that the Pipsisewah or the Skeezicks
doesn’t get you!” begged Nurse Jane.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i016.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily hopped and jumped through the woods, with the
empty flour sack over his shoulder. He was thinking how good the nut
cake would taste when, all of a sudden, the bunny rabbit gentleman came
to a big pile of chestnuts under a tree. The wind has blown them down,
but they were still in the stickery, prickery burrs, Jack Frost not having
cracked them open. Uncle Wiggily did not know as much about chestnuts
as did Johnnie and Billie, the squirrels, and picked up the nuts with
his bare paws. “Ouch,” he cried. “I’m stuck full of splinters!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>While Uncle Wiggily was wondering how he could fill his bag with
chestnuts, and not get the stickers in his paws, along through the woods
came Charlie and Arabella Chick, the little rooster boy and the little hen
girl. “Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” crowed Charlie, “Arabella and I will pick up
the stickery chestnuts for you in our beaks. They won’t stick us!” Uncle
Wiggily said that would be very kind. So, while the bunny held open
the bag, Charlie and Arabella filled it with the prickly chestnuts. And
what do you suppose the Pipe and Skee are going to do?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye, Uncle Wiggily! Good-bye!” crowed Charlie the rooster
chap, as the bunny rabbit gentleman’s bag was filled with chestnuts, and
he started for his hollow stump bungalow. “Good-bye!” answered Uncle
Wiggily. “When Nurse Jane bakes the nut cake, I’ll save you each a
piece for having so kindly helped me!” The Pipsisewah, hiding behind
a tree with the Skeezicks, heard what the bunny said and cried:
“He must have a cake in that bag! When he isn’t looking, I’ll tear
the bag open with my claws and the cake will fall out!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily walked along through the woods, with the bag of
chestnut burrs over his shoulder. “When I get home,” thought the bunny,
“I’ll get Johnnie and Billie Bushytail to help me take the stickers off
the chestnuts, and then Nurse Jane can make the cake.” Following behind
Uncle Wiggily, laughing and skipping and full of glee, was the old
Pipsisewah and also Mr. Skee. “Won’t we have a good time when I rip
that bag open with my claws, and Uncle Wiggily’s cake falls out!” cried
the Pip. “Indeed we will!” said the Skee. But you wait and see.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i020.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Hello there, Johnnie and Billie!” cried Uncle Wiggily, as he saw
the two squirrel boys up in a tree. “Did you find any nuts?” the bunny
asked them. “Yes, a few,” answered Billie. “What’s in your bag, Uncle
Wiggily?” asked Johnnie. “Oh, something good,” replied the bunny rabbit.
“Charlie and Arabella Chick helped me, but if it hadn’t been for you I
never would have thought of nut cake. So come down to my hollow stump
bungalow!” Johnnie and Billie were delighted. “Now is my chance!”
whispered the Pip to the Skee. “Watch the cake fall out of the bag!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“My goodness me sakes alive and a peanut lollypop! What happened?”
cried Uncle Wiggily, looking around as he felt the bag on his
back ripped open. “What’s the matter?” Johnnie and Billie laughed to
see the Pipsisewah and Skeezicks all stuck up with the sharp chestnut
burrs. “That’s what happened, Uncle Wiggily!” chattered Billie. “The
Pip and Skee were fooled all right!” “You said there was cake in that
bag!” growled the Skee, picking a chestnut splinter from his nose. “I
thought so,” sadly howled the Pip, who had a splinter in each ear.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Well, everything came out all right, didn’t it, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked Johnnie, as Nurse Jane gave him another slice of cake. “Yes, everything
came out all right—even the prickly chestnut burrs out of my
bag!” laughed the bunny. “The Pip and Skee won’t bother me again
very soon. They are full of splinters.” Charlie and Arabella had helped
pick up the chestnuts the second time, the bunny fixed the hole made by
the Pipsisewah, and Johnnie and Billie opened the chestnuts. Nurse Jane
made the cake. Everybody was happy except the Pip and the Skee.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Uncle Wiggily Had a Good Time Roasting Marshmallow Candies. The Fuzzy Fox Did Not Have Quite So Much Fun. Oh, Dear!</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>“Dear me! What’s all this?” asked Uncle Wiggily Longears one
day, as he sat in his hollow stump bungalow reading the paper. Into
his sitting room came Sammie and Susie Littletail, the rabbits; Johnnie
and Billie Bushytail, the squirrels; Lulu, Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble,
the ducks; Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy dog
boys, and Nannie and Billie Wagtail, the goats. “What’s the matter?”
asked Uncle Wiggily. “Will you please come to the woods and help us
roast marshmallow candies?” asked Sammie. “I will,” said Uncle.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Off to the woods went the bunny rabbit gentleman and his animal
friends. They built a little fire and then opened the boxes of marshmallow
candies. Uncle Wiggily made some long, sharp-pointed sticks
for the children and then they began to roast the sweet chunks of
sticky candy. All of a sudden Susie Littletail held her marshmallow
too close to the blaze, and it caught fire. “Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” cried
Susie. “What shall I do? My candy is on fire!” Uncle Wiggily
twinkled his pink nose and said: “Be calm, my child!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i026.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Fire! Fire!” cried Billie Wagtail, the goat boy. “Call out the
fire engines! I’ll be the chief!” Billie took some bark from a white
birch tree and made himself a trumpet, so he could shout at the other
animal boys. Uncle Wiggily ran quickly to a spring near by, and,
scooping up a lot of water in his tall silk hat, he poured it on Susie’s
blazing, smoking marshmallow. “Now the fire is out!” said the
bunny. Some of the animal girls almost fainted, but the boys found
empty tin cans and brought them full of water.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i027.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The water from Uncle Wiggily’s tall silk hat soon put out the fire
in Susie’s marshmallow, and everything was nice again. Uncle Wiggily
and the other animal boys and girls were just going to roast more
candies when, all of a sudden, Nannie Wagtail, the goat girl, sat down
in a pile of sticky marshmallows which Billie Bushytail left on top of
a flat stump. “Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Uncle Wiggily!” bleated Nannie.
“I’m stuck fast! Oh, has a bear got me?” The bunny laughed. “You
are only stuck on the sticky candies,” he said. “I’ll pull you loose!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i028.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Now, all together! Pull!” cried Uncle Wiggily, when they had
taken hold of Nannie, the goat girl. “Pull hard, everybody!” said the
bunny rabbit gentleman, “and we’ll soon have Nannie loose from the
sticky marshmallows. You shouldn’t have left them there, Billie.”
The squirrel boy said he was sorry. Then, with laughter and shouts,
they all pulled, one, two, three! Nannie slowly came loose from
where she was stuck on the stump. Over in the woods, the bad old fox
tramp heard the noise. “I must see what that is,” he said.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i029.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>All of a sudden, just as Uncle Wiggily and the animal boys and
girls were going to start roasting marshmallows again, right through
the bushes jumped the bad old fuzzy tramp fox. Susie’s candy-fire
had been put out, Nannie had been pulled loose from the stump, and
here was new trouble. “How dare you roast marshmallows in my
woods?” growled the fox. “We didn’t know these were your woods,”
spoke Uncle Wiggily, politely. “Well, they are!” grumbled the fox.
“And, just for that, I’m going to bite a lot of souse off your ears.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i030.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily was brave. As soon as the fox jumped through the
bushes the bunny rabbit began to think of a way to save himself and
the animal boys and girls. Uncle Wiggily whispered to Billie Wagtail
and Jackie Bow Wow to put a lot of the sticky marshmallow candies
on a flat stump behind the fox. Then the bunny rabbit said to the
fuzzy chap: “Wouldn’t you like to roast a marshmallow before you bite
my souse?” The fox growled and said: “Well, I s’pose I might as well!
Candy goes well with souse. I’ll roast one.” The fox began to do this.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When Uncle Wiggily saw that the pile of sticky candies was in
readiness on the flat stump behind the fuzzy fox, the bunny rabbit
made a low and polite bow with his tall silk hat and said: “Won’t you
please be seated, Mr. Fox, while you are roasting your candy? It may
take some little time, and perhaps you will get tired. Sit down, I pray
you.” The fox growled and said: “Well, I s’pose I might!” So he
got ready to sit down. Billie and Jackie laughed so hard, but in whispers,
they could hardly stand up. “Wait till he sits down,” said Billie.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i032.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, wow! Double wow and some feather pillows!” howled the
fox, as he felt himself caught by the sticky candies. “What has happened?”
Uncle Wiggily, first having told the animal children to run
along toward their homes, blew a kiss to the fuzzy fox, who was caught
fast. “Lots has happened,” said the bunny rabbit. “You thought you
would catch me, but you are caught yourself! It will be a good while
before you can pull yourself loose, Mr. Fox!” The fox growled and
grumbled, but he could not get away. So Uncle Wiggily was saved.</p>
